     The minor version number will be updated when attributes are added to 
     existing elements, or when new optional elements are added to this spec.  
     The implementation will be required to ignore elements/attributes that 
     it does not support.  When the relationship between existing elements 
     changes, or when new required elements are added, then the Major version
     number will be updated, which may require a new revision of AVWorks.
