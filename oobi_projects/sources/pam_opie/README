pam_opie 0.21
=============
May 26, 1998

	Copyright (C) 1997-1998, Andy Berkheimer <andy@tho.org>

	This adds support for OPIE authentication to PAM. OPIE is a
	freely available one time password system based on S/Key. This
	module is available under the terms of the GPL.

	The module currently only supports authentication. In the future 
	it may handle password management as well using OTP extended
	responses. Eventually this module will be fully compliant with
	the server requirements of the latest OTP specification (as of
	Jul 31, 1997, this is RFC 1938). Also, the module does not
	yet recognize any extra parameters.

	To compile the module, you can either put the directory in the
	Linux-PAM source tree under the Linux-PAM-x.y/modules directory
	or compile it standalone (I think - let me know if you run into 
	problems with this). Hit make, then make install, and voila.

	Right now, I can say with fair certainty that this will work
	with Linux-PAM 0.59 under Redhat 5.0.  For any other setup,
	it should probably work, but I can't guarantee it. If
	you find problems on other system setups, let me know
	(especially if you figured out how to fix them).

	I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who tries this module,
	whether it be with bug reports, patches, suggestions, critiques, 
	or just to tell me that it works for you too. I may be too busy
	to reply, but don't worry, every mail I get gives me that warm
	fuzzy feeling.

	The most recent version of this module will be available from
	http://www.tho.org/~andy/pam-opie.html.

WHAT'S NEW

Version 0.21: May 26, 1998

	Seems that I forgot to actually include my simpler
	Makefile setup in the release tarball of 0.21. This
	has been remedied.

Version 0.2: April 20, 1998

	Upgraded the libopie used from 2.31 to 2.32. Changed the
	Makefile setup for building libopie to be simpler.

	Modified the Makefile so that it should be possible to
	build the pam_opie module without needing the entire Linux-PAM
	source tree.

	Fixed a few sporadic segmentation faults.
	
Version 0.1: July 31, 1997
