#  For proper security, this file SHOULD have permissions 0600,
#  that is readable by root, and NO ONE else.  If anyone other than
#  root can read this file, then they can spoof responses from the server!
#
#  There are 5 fields per line in this file.  There may be multiple
#  lines.  Blank lines or lines beginning with '#' are treated as
#  comments, and are ignored.  The fields are:
#
#  serverType server[:port] secret timeout retries svctype
#
#  - the serverType specifies which type of the server :
#    authentication server or accounting server. 
#    Valid entries are:  "acct" and "auth".
# 
#  - the server is the IP address or hostname of the RADIUS server.
#
#  - the port name or number is optional.  The default port name is
#  "radius", and is looked up from /etc/services.
#
#  - secret: The shared password required for communication with the 
#  Radius server.
#
#  - the timeout field controls how many seconds the module waits before
#  deciding that the server has failed to respond. Default : 3 sec.
#
#  - the retries : the number of times each Radius server is tried
#  before another is contacted.
#
#  - the svctype field determines the criteria used for determining if an
#    user has administrative rights. If it is set to 1, then the
#    "service_type" attribute is used as criteria. If it is set to 0, or
#    left undefined, then the "group_name" attribute is used as criteria.
#    This field is optional and effective for authentication servers only.
#
#  If multiple RADIUS server lines exist, they are tried in order.  The
#  first server to return success or failure causes the module to return
#  success or failure.  Only if a server fails to response is it skipped,
#  and the next server in turn is used.
#
#
# serverType  server[:port] shared_secret timeout retries svctype
  auth        127.0.0.1	    secret        3       2
  acct        127.0.0.1     secret        3       2

# auth        other-server  other-secret  3       1
