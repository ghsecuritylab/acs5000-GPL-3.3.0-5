Changes done by Cyclades
-------------------------

Dec,2005 - ESOARES
------------------
1. For each Mindterm parameter (applet or application) is necessary to register it in com.mindbright.ssh.SSHPropertyHandler.defaultPropDesc
	Static parameters are set up in WEB-INF/jnlp/mindterm.properties. 
	Dinamic parameters are merged when to the static ones and passed to Applet/JWS application.	

2. com.mindbright.ssh.SSHMenuHandlerFullSwing : Menu is added to the LayoutManager rather than set in JFrame, to be useful also for applets.
	Restriction: Work around done using swing was sucessfull because JMenuBar extends JComponent. However it is not viable in JDK 1.1 because java.awt.MenuBar does not extend java.awt.Component.
		
3. com.mindbright.ssh.SSHMenuHandlerFull : "send break" menu item configuration.
		
4. com.mindbright.ssh.SSHInteractiveClient : Mindterm information and logo commented out in startup.
	Watch the little information displayed on Mindterm startup. 
		
5. com.mindbright.gui.AWTConvenience.isSwingJFrame : Modified to force use of swing according to parameter force-swing (true/false)
			

6. GUIInterface,GUIAWT, GUISwing (com.mindbright.gui) : Method added to show dialog with buttons OK,NO and CANCEL (swing only).
	
7. Mindterm : Support for argument --app in Application mode to accept parameters from stand-alone application
	
8. Mindterm logo replaced by Cyclades logo (src/defaults/logo.gif) 
		
9. MindTerm3 : Set up username/password and server parameters, handle session timeout closing Applet/JWS window. 


Tests
-----------------
1. You may change WEB-INF/jnlp/mindterm.properties

2. Menu support in Applet - watch it. force-swing property must be set to true in WEB-INF/jnlp/mindterm.properties.

3. Send break 
		A. Connect to a server, e.g. 172.22.78.2.
		B. Click on menu item File/Send Break
		C. The break must be send in a empty line (after a CRLF). If is not the case, one dialog will appear asking the user to send the CRLF.
		
4. Cyclades logo - Go to menu Help/About Mindterm.

5. Username/password set up for console/device - As soon as Mindterm starts, it should connect to the proper console/device automatically
	
6. Session timeout - If session timeout is enabled for the user, the Applet/JWS application will close when HTTP session timeouts out.
