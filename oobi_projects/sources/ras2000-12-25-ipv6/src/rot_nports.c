/* The function that was defined here, get_machine_type(), is
   a cross-product function, so it really belongs in a shared library
   such as libcyc.  The use of get_machine_type() is deprecated but
   still available if you link against libcyc (e.g. -lcyc) and include
   the header cyc.h (e.g. #include <cyc.h>) */
