## The all entry is used as a template for all others. This means that
## setting all.debug to 0, you set s0.debug, s1.debug, s2.debug etc.

# to "0" or "1". This option does not have effect on non-radius
# authentication - i.e. if "authtype" is "none" or if you do a local login.

# Realms.  Again, user@host login names are recognized, but the @host
# part is used to select different authentication/accounting hosts.
# In the first example, all four hosts are actually defined; in the
# second, there is only one authentication and one accounting host.
# Undefined hosts must be represented by empty strings.  The order
# is @realm authhost1 accthost1 authhost2 accthost2.
# '>' means that the @host part is a suffix, and '-' tells the program
# to strip the suffix if providing a login service.  '<' and '+' are
# counterparts to '>' and '-', as shown in the third example, which
# does what UUCPHACK has existed for.
#
# Realm definitions are special because subsequent definitions don't
# replace the previous ones, but add to them.
