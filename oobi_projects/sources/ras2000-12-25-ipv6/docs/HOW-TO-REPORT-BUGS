Make sure you give following info:

1. What linux distribution do you use (e.g. Slackware-3.6, Redhat-5.2, etc.).
2. What kernel do you use (uname -a).
3. What glibc/libc version do you use (ls -la /lib/libc.*).
4. Attach your /etc/portslave/pslave.conf
5. If you suspect there is a problem with portslave <---> radius daemon
   communication, attach also your radius daemon config files - the "users"
   and "clients" files (these are different for different radius servers).
6. A) Select a test port on your access server, then enable debugging for that
      port by setting the corresponding "sN.debug" item to 1 (N is the number
      of your test port).
   B) Add "debug kdebug7" to the command line options of radius pppd.
   C) Edit your /etc/syslog.conf and add following lines to it:

      local6.*		-/var/log/portslave
      daemon.*		-/var/log/portslave

      then "killall -HUP syslogd".
   D) After triggering the bug, attach the part of /var/log/portslave
      generated by portslave on the test port.
