31_Dec_1999-1 (Unofficial)
  * Removed unnecessary warning for users that disconnect without having
    been logged in.
  * Replaced all calls to sprintf() with calls to snprintf()

03_Dec_1999-1 (Unofficial)
  * Updated changelog for 24_Nov_1999-2
  * Added two new options to pppd-radius:
    ip-up-script - specifies pathname of ip-up script
    ip-down-script - specifies pathname of ip-down script
  * Fixed a bug in radius accounting which caused portslave sometimes to
    send logout packets for users that were not logged in.

24_Nov_1999-2 (Unofficial)
  * Included missing errno.h which broke compile on some machines.

24_Nov_1999-1 (Unofficial)
  * Now ip_up_hook() is called when IP protocol goes up.

23_Nov_1999-3 (Unofficial)
  * Updated Portslave to pppd-2.3.10.

18_Nov_1999-2 (Unofficial)
  * Dropped select() support. We use poll() instead.
  * Changed semantics of STATUS chat keyword. Now it does not update the
    wtmp logfile. Also now sysutmp and syswtmp config items do not have
    effect on the result of the STATUS keyword.

16_Nov_1999-2 (Unofficial)
  * Applied Josh Green's patch that fixed bug in portslave logging.
  * Fixed a bug which effectively always allowed local logins even if they
    were disabled in the config file.
  * Some cleanups of the syslog code.

17_Sep_1999-5 (Unofficial)
  * Changed the name of my development snapshots, so they are not confused
    with the official stable/pre versions.
  * Added new chat keywords:
     TIMEOUT N - Sets chat timeout to N. 0 means infinite timeout.
     WAIT DCD  - Waits for modem carrier. Affected by chat timeout.
     STATUS login_format from_format - Updates utmp/wtmp files

     Best reference for the time being is the new pslave.conf.

  * Removed lots of config items:
     waitfor, aa, stripnames, answer, checktime, checkchat
  * Minimum loglevel fixed in libpsr (LOG_DEBUG and LOG_INFO messages were
    not logged).
  * Send accounting start request only once per user login.
  * Lots of code cleanup here and there.

1.2.0pre13beta2 (Unofficial)
  * You need to run ./configure before calling "make". Just use

     make clean
     ./configure
     make
     make install

     to compile and install portslave

  * all.radnullpass config item - whether to accept "" passwords.
  * Configurable utmp/wtmp strings - uses printf-like format strings.
  * Some minor code cleanups.

1.2.0pre12
  * Fixed update_framed_route(). Changed operation to staircase order.
    (FIFO/LIFO) IE Last entry to be added is the first to be deleted.
    (Fixes possible dependency problems)
  * update_filter_id tested with PPP and AutoPPP. Fixed command line.
    Changed operation to staircase order. (FIFO/LIFO) IE Last entry to
    be added is the first to be deleted. (Fixes possible dependency
    problems)
  * Reply-Message fixed. (I think. Seeing extra output but think it's the
    RADIUS server. Reports please.)
  * Cleaned some log output.
  * Merged Vesselin's  pre10 poll patch

1.2.0pre11

  * Portslave now toggles the DTR line when opening the serial port.
    It previously relied on the externally spawned program to close
    the connection. PPPD would close the line fine. SLIP, Rlogin,
    or a non-autoppp password failure would NOT. (Bug IMHO)
  * Search services file for radius and radacct ports.
  * Session-Timeout support, to limit the maximum connection time.
  * New 'big utmp' format (when using libc6 or similar)
  	Entire IP stored in utmp, as well as connect string.
  * Update utmp with:
		user:'Incoming'  status:'HANKSHAKE' (modem answer)
		user:'Connected' status:connect string (speed)
  * Changed ctlportslave to work with utmp 'status' messages.
  * Changed ctlportslave to report actual type when called as 'finger' 
    instead of just 'Network'.
  * New ctlportslave view, 'detailed'
  * New password option for ctlportslave as fingerd.
  * New reset ports option for ctlportslave as fingerd.
  * New 'UPTIME' compile option for ctlportslave as fingerd.
  * Byte accounting fixed for non-AUTOPPP.
  * Byte accounting added for SLIP and CSLIP. (Portslave now forks)
  * Filter ID patch added.
  * SSH service patch added.
  * Realms support patch added. UUCPHACK code removed.
  * Portslave no longer depends on the external program stty.
  * Operate on stdin option. (Backend mgetty)
  * Modem checking feature.
  * Compiler routines optimized. (No debug. Binaries now smaller)
  * Various minor bug fixes.
  * Various buffer overflow fixes.
  * PPPD 2.3.8 (ppp 2.2 support purged)
  * Many more things forgotten...

portslave (1.16) cistron; urgency=low

   * Build autoppp part of portslave as shared lib, linked in on-demand
     by ppp-2.2.0f.
   * Added MD5 auth for accounting packets;
     thanks to Eric Stern <estern@squall.mgl.ca>
   * Fixed bug in Reply-Message handling. Or actually, string handling
     in general. Thanks to Jens Glaser <jens@regio.net>
   * Now logs everything after CONNECT to radius with Connect-Info.
   * Added "porttype" configuration variable, based on a suggestion
     from Carl Privitt <cprivitt@granite.sage.net>.
   * Check for Framed-Protocol = PPP after authentication in pppd
   * Fix comment handling of config file parser
   * Added RADIUS logging of sent/recv octets for PPP
     This should now work reliably minus 1 or 2 seconds before hangup.
   * Added ctlportslave utility. Can be used as shell for `!root', adds
     portmaster-like command line admin interface. Very simplistic
     but useful for packages like pmmon.
   * Fixed length field of IP address / integer (was 6 instead of 4)
     Do not include trailing '\0' in strings.
   * Now also compiles with GNU libc (aka libc6). Diffs submitted by
     <chuck@innet.com>.
   * Added conf.stripnames option

portslave (1.15) cistron; urgency=low

   * lib.c:getline() now accepts \r, \r\n, \n as end-of-line.
   * getty:login() turns off input CRNL translation
   * Added new feature: portslave can now emulate a modem. Set
     "sXX.emumodem 1" to enable this feature.

   * Add support for radius Idle-Timeout attribute

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Thu, 5 Jun 1997 20:49:21 +0200

portslave (1.14) cistron; urgency=low

   * Added copyright notice to README (GPL)
   * Add note about ripd to README
   * Change default MTU in sample server.cfg to 1500 - some PPP implementations
     have trouble with fragmentation.

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Wed, 7 May 1997 13:57:32 +0200

portslave (1.13) cistron; urgency=low

   * Added CREAD to the c_cflag initialization. This should fix the digiboards.
     (Fix by Jean-Francois Micouleau <Jean-Francois.Micouleau@utc.fr>)
   * Added telnet support. Maybe also pass username if known?

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Thu, 24 Apr 1997 21:36:16 +0200

portslave (1.12) cistron; urgency=high

   * Now sends accounting requests to the radius accounting port (1646)
     instead of the authentication port (1645) - funny that nobody found
     this obvious bug yet (and that it actually _worked_ ..)
   * Some extra info added to server.cfg
   * Remove MRU settings; use MTU for both MTU and MRU
   * Fix '-' argument

  -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> Thu, 6 Feb 1997 22:22:16 +0100

portslave (1.11) cistron; urgency=low

  * Added comment in server.cfg about "stuck in negotation" loop that
    ppp-2.2.0f can get into with leased lines, with a workaround. It
    seems to work for a lot of people except me :(. Under investigation.
  * Fix for syslog() not working on port 0: Jens Glaser <jens@glaser.com>

  -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl> Thu, 14 Nov 1996 13:45:53 +0100

portslave (1.10) cistron; urgency=high

  * Fixed SLIP/CSLIP support that I broke in 1.0.8 or so.

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Mon, 29 Oct 1996 15:41:32 +0100

portslave (1.09) cistron; urgency=low

  * Fixed leased-line support (again; must have misplaced a part of
    some previous changes)

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Mon, 22 Oct 1996 11:59:21 +0200

portslave (1.08) cistron; urgency=low

  * Fixed local syslog logging
  * Fixed portslave-over-telnet
  * Added debug option, standard turned off.

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Mon, 14 Oct 1996 18:12:57 +0200

portslave (1.07a) cistron; urgency=low

  * Removed the nonsense about pap-secrets.

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Mon, 08 Oct 1996 18:02:16 +0200

portslave (1.07) cistron; urgency=low

  * Fixed the sample server.cfg file; it had a few typos and missing
    features (esp. the leased-line example)
  * Fixed leased-line support
  * Note about /etc/ppp/pap-secrets in README

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Mon, 07 Oct 1996 13:28:21 +0200

portslave (1.06) cistron; urgency=low

  * Added support for portslave - over - telnetd. portslave now checks if
    the first argument starts with '-'. If so, it uses ttyname(0) to find
    the right entry in the server.cfg file.

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Wed, 02 Oct 1996 16:54:29 +0200

portslave (1.05) cistron; urgency=high

  * Fixed CLOCAL stuff (only ever set if port.dcd is 0). This works around
    a bug in the Comtrol Rocketport driver.
  * Added ChangeLog file.

 -- Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>  Tue, 01 Oct 1996 17:06:40 +0200
