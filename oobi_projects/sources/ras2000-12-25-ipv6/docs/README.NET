		How to run portslave under telnetd.

Some people want to run portslave on the telnet port of their machine.
For example, one guy has terminal servers in 8 bit clean pass-through mode
that connect a dialin user to a telnet session on a Linux machine. The
portslave runs there.

I haven't tested this myself yet, so I'm not sure if it works :)

You can do this in 2 ways:

1. On standard telnet port 23, instead of the regular login program.

   You must have a recent telnetd for this. The Debian distribution has,
   I don't know about others. Edit your /etc/inetd.conf file, and
   look for the line:

   telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.telnetd

   At the end of the line, add "-L /usr/local/portslave/bin/portslave".

2. On another non-standard port, using TCP-Clear (no telnet protocol).

   To your /etc/services file, add:

   portslave  1923/tcp  # (adjust port number to taste)

   And to /etc/inetd.conf, add:

   telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd \
		/usr/local/portslave/bin/portslave -

   (That should all be on one line without the `\'. Note the `-').

Now let inetd reload its config files with "killall -1 inetd".


To let portslave know it should not try to initialize a modem, and that
it should use pty ports, change your server.cfg file as follows:

1. Turn off modem support.
   In server.cfg add:

   all.initchat ""
   all.waitfor  ""
   all.answer   ""

2. Define *all* pseudo terminals on your system in server.cfg (sorry,
   there's no other way right now).

   s0.tty     ttyp0
   s1.tty     ttyp1
   [...]
   s63.tty    ttysf

Oh in case you're wondering how it works - telnetd executes "login" or in this
case "portslave" with a slew of options - at least "-h remote_hostname".
Portslave simply detects the first "-" and sees that it's NOT a portnumber,
so it tries to find the portnumber based on the tty it's running on instead
of the other way around.

That's all!
