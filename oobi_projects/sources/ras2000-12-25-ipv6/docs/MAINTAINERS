  1.16 is the last version from me. Here in the Netherlands, people are
  moving away from the traditional terminal server+modems solution.
  From Januari 1st, 1998 we will only use ISDN PRI solutions.
  Whoever wants to take over portslave is free to do so, but you might
  want to contact me first to see if noone else is working on it yet
  so that I can try to coordinate it a bit.
