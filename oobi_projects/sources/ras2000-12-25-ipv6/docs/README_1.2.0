FIX ME release date

    Cistron RADIUS portslave  1.2.0  dcinege@psychosis.com  1999-08-01


0. IMPORTANT

  * Portslave requires you use a patched PPPD for RADIUS authentication.
    If you do not use the PPPD included with the distribution, don't expect
    portslave to be of much use.

  * PPPD 2.3.8 has been released with 1.2.0. If you are using Linux 2.0
    you MUST patch your kernel to the PPP 2.3 level. Linux 2.2 does not
    require any patching.

1. DISCLAIMER.

  There is no warranty of any kind. Please see the LICENSE file for
  additional information.

2. INTRODUCTION.

  This is the Portslave RADIUS client. RADIUS (Remote Authentication
  Dial-In User Service), simply put allows you to authenticate logins from
  a central RADIUS server without having to keep user account information
  on multiple machines. As the name states RADIUS is primarily used in
  terminal servers (aka RAS: Remote Auth Servers) for logging in dial in modem
  users. Portslave can 'answer the line' and act as the RADIUS client for this
  as well as other Unix services such as telnet and secure shell (ssh).
  
3. RADIUS

  You will need at least one RADIUS server on one of your systems. These
  are available from ftp.livingston.com (the original livingston radius-1.16)
  and from ftp.merit.edu (the MERIT version). There are also a lot of
  alternate servers and patches floating around.

  One alternate simple but powerful RADIUS server is the Cistron server.
  You can find it @ http://www.miquels.cistron.nl/radius/

  You *need* a working RADIUS server first, and you have to understand
  how it works before you can continue.

  Note that if you want to offer shell-logins you need an updated dictionary
  file with the "Shell-User" entry. Use "Login-Service = Shell-User" to
  let a user use an account on the local machine. BTW, the official new
  name for this is actually "Administrative-User".

4. BUILDING THE SOFTWARE.

  The software was built under x86 Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 with glibc 2.0.7
  (libc6), as well as Slackware with libc5. It has also been proofed against
  the big-endian SPARC and Alpha platforms. Some parts of the code (byte
  accounting) are very Linux specific and it may take some recoding to
  get a compile and full functionality on non-Linux based operating systems.
  
  Please note:
    Using libc5 will result in some reduced funtionality.
    (ctlportslave output and utmp logging are less verbose)
  
    Compiling the program for Linux 2.0 will result in HIGHLY inaccurate
    traffic reporting for non-PPP interfaces (SLIP/CSLIP)

  
  First you should edit src/conf.h to suit your system and needs.
  
  Type 'make' in the main directory all pieces of the software should be
  compiled.

  If you get an error like "-dl not found", check that you have a symbolic
  link in /usr/lib called "libdl.so" that links to /lib/libdl.so.x.x.x.
  It should look like this:

  lrwxrwxrwx   1 root    root   20 Oct  9 18:21 libdl.so -> /lib/libdl.so.1.9.6

5. INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE.

  If you use the default paths, you need to install the next files:

  pslave.conf			/etc/portslave/pslave.conf
  src/portslave			/usr/local/sbin/portslave
  src/ctlportslave		/usr/local/sbin/ctlportslave
  src/radinit			/usr/local/sbin/radinit
  libpsr/libpsr.o		/usr/local/lib/libpsr.o
  ppp-2.3.X-radius/pppd/pppd	/usr/local/sbin/pppd-radius
  rlogin-8.10/rlogin		/usr/local/bin/rlogin-radius

  You can use the provided "install.sh" script to do this for you.
  ("make install" also works, it calls the "install.sh" script).
  It's usually safer to just move all files by hand.
  
  Notice that the Portslave RADIUS specific pppd and rlogin binaries
  prepend a '-radius' suffix so they can peacefully co-exist with
  the non-RADIUS versions. (Hint: pppd-radius uses /etc/pppd-radius
  for any additional ppd config files)

6. CONFIGURATION

  First you'll have to choose where to let the portslaves log their
  messages. The portslaves can use both a local or a remote syslog
  daemon. On that machine, do the following:

  o add "local6      /var/log/local6.log" to /etc/syslog.conf
  o change any lines that look like "*.debug" or "*.info" to
    "*.debug;local6.none" to prevent sensitive info being logged to
    maybe publically readable files.
  o Create /var/log/local6.log and chmod 600 it so that it's safe.

  o If you have a new syslog daemon, you might have to do some special
    things to let it listen to requests from the net. syslogd-1.3 needs
    the "-r" flag at startup, for example.

  Now you'll have to edit /etc/portslave/pslave.conf". The
  comments in that file are the only documentation at the moment ;)

7. EXECUTION

  Portslave is designed to be spawned by init. This is done by adding a line
  in your /etc/inittab for every port that you have configured. These lines
  have to look like this:

  T0:23:respawn:/usr/local/portslave/bin/portslave 0
  [...]
  T31:23:respawn:/usr/local/portslave/bin/portslave 31

  Note that the first field (the "id" field) can only have more than 2
  characters if you have a recent sysvinit (>= 2.60) compiled with a
  recent libc (>= 5.2.18). This doesn't matter; 2 characters is also fine
  as long as the id fields are unique.


  You'll have to add a call to "/usr/local/sbin/radinit" in your
  system startup scripts. If you run Debian, you can put the following
  script in the file /etc/rc.boot/radinit :

  #! /bin/sh
  /usr/local/portslave/bin/radinit

  This program updates the file /var/log/radsession.id that generates
  unique session ID's. It has to be updated every boot according to the
  RADIUS specifications.


8. CTLPORTSLAVE, FINGERD

   Ctlportslave gets installed setuid root, group daemon.
   -rwsr-x---   1 root      daemon        12428 Jun 21 04:00 ctlportslave 

   It offers a very limited subset of the Portmaster interface, and as of
   1.2.0 some of it's own unique features.
   
   It offers two modes of operation, as a client for the "pmmon" utility from
   Brad Owens, <thrasher@squashduck.com>, or when invoked with '-f' as a quasi
   emulation of the finger daemon. 

   7.1 CTLPORTSLAVE AS PMMON CLIENT (depreciated)

   Add the following to /etc/passwd and set the password for `!root'
   using the "passwd \!root" command:

   !root:x:999:1:Portslave Admin:/tmp:/usr/local/sbin/ctlportslave

   999 is a free UID, 1 is the GID of the daemon group on your machine.

   ctlportslave can also be invoked ont he local machine for 'pmmon' style
   access without the above set up.

   Unless you already have a desire to use pmmon, it it recommended you
   only complete the 'finger' set up.

   7.2 CTLPORTSLAVE AS FINGERD (prefered)

   Add this to /etc/inetd.conf. Comment out the existing fingerd entry
   if needed:

   finger stream tcp nowait nobody.daemon /usr/sbin/tcpd 
   			/usr/local/sbin/ctlportslave -f
			  
			  ctlportslave -f -p psfinger -r psreset

ps-finger		7979/tcp
			  

   (all on one line). Now send SIGHUP to the running inetd.
   NOTE that fingerd runs as user nobody, group daemon.
   
   ctlportslave can also be renamed (or smylinked) with 'finger' in it's name
   and it will be run as finger without the '-f'. This is provided for 
   backwards compatability and this method has depreciated.
   

9. FILES IN /etc/ppp-radius

  Make sure there is no /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file. If it is present, PAP
  authentication over RADIUS will not work: the PPP daemon will not look
  any further then the pap-secrets file.

  Also there must be 2 files "ip-up" and "ip-down" there, that are
  executable. A file with a single first line "#! /bin/sh" will do.
  Chmod those files to 755.

  You also need an options file there. That file must preferably also
  be empty (0 bytes).


10. AND NOW...

  Give an "init q" and the portslaves should start. You can see in the
  logfile (/var/log/local6.log) what exactly is happening.

  If you want to see much more debug output, set the "debug" entry in
  the "server.cfg" config file to 1, and add the keyword "debug" to
  both lines of ppp options (all.pppopt and all.autoppp). All debugging
  output will still go to the "local6.log" file.

11. MORE INFO.

  You can try the the linux-isp mailing list, which on a lot of sites
  used to be accessible as the newsgroup linux.admin.isp (not anymore).
  For the mailing list, send a message with "help" in the body to
  linuxisp-request@friendly.jeffnet.org. Several people on that list are
  successfully using this software.
