This product runs an embedded version of the Linux kernel. Even if you are
an experienced Linux user, please do NOT use the generic system tools for
networking configuration.

Please consult the user's guide included on the CD-ROM (.\doc\xxx.pdf)**
and at www.apc.com for full instructions on the configuration setup of the
APC KVM.

The Product Manual details the configuration process. Here is a summary 
of what you need to do in order to get the product working:

1) Use the "wiz" command to quickly configure the network (IP address, network 
   mask, DNS, default gateway). When asked, select the options to make the 
   changes effective and to save the configuration to flash.
2) Open the Internet Explorer or Netscape in a workstation and point to the 
   IP address configured. Log in as apc (password apc).
3) Press the "Wizard" button. After going through all the steps, press the 
   "Apply Changes" button.

Also, if you are upgrading from a previous firmware version, read the document
"/upgrade_notes" that provides the information you need to setup your board 
properly.
