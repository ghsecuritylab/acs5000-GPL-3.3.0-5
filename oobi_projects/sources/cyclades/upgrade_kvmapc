===============================================================================
                        UPGRADE to Version 2.4.0
===============================================================================


REMARKS
=======
      . In this document we assume that the APC's KVM (hereafter referred 
	to as APC-KVM) is already running the new Linux Kernel Image 
	(2.4.17) and that it will be the version used from now on.

      . For more information about new features, please read the up-to-date
        Release Notes and the APC documentation.

      . For those who are new to Linux/Unix, we recommend reading appendix A
        in the APC User's Guide.


UPGRADING OVERVIEW
==================

The APC-KVM packages may be updated from one version to another. So, if the 
user has a APC-KVM running an earlier version, special care should be taken 
regarding configuration.

The user can choose to start the configuration from scratch by simply doing:

    echo 0 > /proc/flash/script
    reboot

or, the user must perform all steps from all "Upgrading from <version> actions"
with version numbers equal to or greater than the original version of his 
APC-KVM.

In case the option is for upgrading from an earlier version keeping the current
configuration (not start from scratch), please really do ALL upgrade actions
listed for ALL versions equal and newer then the current one.

To run a new configuration the user must execute the following command:

    daemon.sh 

To save a new configuration into flash the user must execute
the following command:

    saveconf

The command "saveconf" is equivalent to the Linux command:

"tar -czf /proc/flash/script -T /etc/config_files"

so, double check that all files which have been changed have their names in the
file /etc/config_files.

If any of the files /etc/inittab, /etc/rc.sysinit, or any user's shell script
executed by /etc/rc.sysinit were changed, the APC-KVM must be rebooted for 
them to take effect.
