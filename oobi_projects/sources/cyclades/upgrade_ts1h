REMARKS

      . For more information about new features, please read the up-to-date
        Release Notes.

      . For those who are new to Linux/Unix, we recommend reading appendix A
        in the Cyclades ACS User's Guide.

NOTE: Cyclades strongly recommends that the user has read the latest User's
Guide available in Cyclades' ftp site before using this new firmware.


UPGRADING OVERVIEW
==================

The TS100rev2  packages may be updated from one version to another. So, if 
the user has an TS100rev2 running an earlier version, special care should be 
taken regarding configuration.

The user can choose to start the configuration from scratch by simply doing:

    echo 0 > /proc/flash/script
    reboot

or, the user must perform all steps from all "Upgrading from <version> actions"
with version numbers equal to or greater than the original version of his 
TS100rev2.

To run a new configuration and save it into flash the user must execute
the following commands:

    runconf
    saveconf

The command "saveconf" is equivalent to the Linux command:

"tar -cf /proc/flash/script -T /etc/config_files"

so, double check that all files which have been changed have their names in the
file /etc/config_files.

If any of the files /etc/inittab, /etc/rc.sysinit, or any user's shell script
executed by /etc/rc.sysinit were changed, the ACS must be rebooted for them to
take effect.
