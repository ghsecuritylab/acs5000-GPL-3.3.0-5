                        Important - Security Advisory
                       -------------------------------
 This device provides access to connected devices. It is critically  important 
 for  you  to  understand  that security risks exist  until  you  perform  the 
 essential precautions described below.
 
 From the factory, this device is configured as follows:
     - The root and admin user accounts have a single password.
     - All serial ports are disabled.
     - DHCP, Telnet, SSHv1, SSHv2, HTTP and HTTPS are all enabled.
 
 Perform the following strongly-recommended actions:
 1. Change  the  root and admin users' passwords as soon as you  are  able  to 
    access this device.
 2. Do not leave the equipment idle without selecting a security profile  with 
    the appropriate level of security for your site.
 3. Select  a  security profile based on your  site's  information  protection 
    policies. Security profiles enable and disable different sets of  services 
    and other features according to three pre-set security levels:  "secured," 
    "moderate,"  and "open." In addition, an administrator can  configure  and 
    select a "custom" security profile.
 4. Enable serial ports and configure user access to these ports using the Web
    Manager or the CLI.
 
 Refer  to  the product documentation for details about selecting  a  security 
 profile and configuring access to serial ports.
