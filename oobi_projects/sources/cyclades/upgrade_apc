===============================================================================
                       UPGRADE to Version 2.6.0-2
===============================================================================

REMARKS
=======
      . For more information about new features,  please  read  the  up-to-date
        Release Notes.

      . For those who are new to Linux/Unix, we recommend reading appendix A in
        the American Power Conversion CPS User's Guide.

NOTE: American Power Conversion strongly recommends that the user has read  the 
latest User's Guide available in American Power Conversion's  ftp  site  before 
using this new firmware.


UPGRADING OVERVIEW
==================

The CPS packages may be updated from one version to another. So,  if  the  user
has an CPS running an earlier version, special care should be  taken  regarding
configuration.

The user can choose to start the configuration from scratch by simply doing:

    defconf
    reboot

or, the user must perform all steps from all "Upgrading from <version> actions"
with version numbers equal to or greater than the original version of his CPS.

In case the option is for upgrading from an earlier version keeping the current
configuration (not start from scratch), please really do  ALL  upgrade  actions
listed for ALL versions equal and newer then the current one.

To run a new configuration and save it into flash the  user  must  execute  the
following commands:

    runconf
    saveconf

The command "saveconf" is equivalent to the Linux command:

"tar -czf /mnt/flash/config.tgz  -T /etc/config_files"

so, double check that all files which have been changed have their names in the
file /etc/config_files.

If any of the files /etc/inittab, /etc/rc.sysinit, or any user's  shell  script
executed by /etc/rc.sysinit were changed, the CPS must be rebooted for them  to
take effect.


Upgrading from 2.6.0-1 Actions
====================================

- username "admin" belonging to  admin  group  can  be  created  by  user  root
  executing "addadmin" utility (shell script) from  shell  command  line.  Note
  that username "admin" can't be added/deleted from WMI or CLI.


Upgrading from 2.3.1 Actions
============================

- new directory was created : /etc/daemon.d. This directory contains all files 
  that are used by daemon.sh utility. The upgrade of the old version is done
  by upgrade260.sh program that runs in the first boot with the 2.6.0 version. 
  Verify your configuration after the first boot.

- the /etc/config_files file was changed. The following actions must be taken:
  1. if you had modified the /etc/config_files file, apply the same changes in 
     the /etc/config_files.save;
  2. copy the /etc/config_files.save file to /etc/config_files file
     (cp /etc/config_files.save /etc/config_files);
  3. save in CF (saveconf command).

- Upgrade of the Linux Kernel to 2.6.11
  . the Compact Flash directory was changed from "/proc/flash" to "/mnt/flash"
  . the name of the configuration file in Compact Flash was changed from 
    "scripts" to "config.tgz"
  . command for reset to factory configuration is : "defconf"
  . the file with modules configuration was changed from '/etc/modules.conf" 
    to "/etc/modprobe.conf"
    .. include your changes in the new file 
    .. add the new file in the /etc/config_files file
  . the /etc/ipsec.conf file was changed :
    .. copy the /etc/ipsec.conf.save file to /etc/ipsec.conf file 
    .. include your changes 

- Upgrade of OpenSSH 4.2p1 :
  . if you use the PuTTY, you need to upgrade it to 0.58 version (The PuTTY 
    had one bug that was fixed in the current version).

- Upgrade of PAM-LDAP - if you use the Secure LDAP, you need to change the
  configuration :
  . in /etc/ldap.conf file, at least one of the following parameters are required 
    if the tls_checkpeer is "yes" :
    .. tls_cacertfile
    .. tls_cacertdir

- TIMEZONE :
  . This feature uses now the /etc/localtime file.
  . The old /etc/TIMEZONE file is erased if you configure this new feature.
  . The image comes with no /etc/localtime file, but it will be created and 
    replace the TIMEZONE file if you use any of the ways of configure timezone.
    
- Authentication Enhancement
  . the /etc/pam.conf file was removed and the /etc/pam.d directory was created
  . the Radius and TACACS+ servers need to be reconfigured by WebUI or CLI 
    (the configuration of these servers in PortSlave configuration was removed).
    
- the /bin/build_DB_ramdisk shell script was changed to use ramdisk type 
  "tmpfs" instead of "ramfs" that has a problem with maxsize.
  
- the name of the PCMCIA modem devices was changed from "/dev/ttySxx" to 
  "/dev/ttyMy". Two dedicated device files (ttyM1 and ttyM2) have been created 
   for the PCMCIA modem devices.
   . if the PCMCIA modem card has already been configured, the user should 
     rename the existing file /etc/ppp/options.ttySxx to /etc/ppp/options.ttyM1

- Kerberos Authentication:
   . Make sure there is an entry in the "hosts table" (/etc/hosts) corresponding
     to the hostname configured for this machine (/etc/hostname).


Upgrading from 2.3.0 Actions
============================

- The files "cert.pem" and "server.pem" were moved to "/etc/CA".
  So, in case old "/new_web/Locale/cert.pem" or "/new_web/Locale/server.pem"
  were added to the "/etc/config_files", the files itself (cert.pem and
  server.pem) must be copied to the new location (/etc/CA) and config_files
  must be corrected to remove the old references and include the new ones
  (/etc/CA/cert.pem and /etc/CA/server.pem). Also, run "saveconf" again to
  correctly update the files in flash memory.

- The driver xirc2ps_cs is configured to make pcmcia card Xircom XE2000 10/100
  Network PC Card Adaptor work in 100Mbps. This configuration was made in
  /etc/modules.conf file by the following line:
  options xirc2ps_cs if_port=4

  If the card Xircom XEM5600 10/100BT Ethernet and 56k V.90 modem combination
  will be used, the above configuration must be commented or deleted.
  So, the following procedure must be executed in order to use XEM5600 card:

  1. edit /etc/modules.conf file; comment the following line:
  #options xirc2ps_cs if_port=4
  2. execute touch command on /lib/modules/2.4.17_mvl21-linuxplanet/modules.dep
     file:
  # touch /lib/modules/2.4.17_mvl21-linuxplanet/modules.dep
  3. edit /etc/config_files to include /etc/modules.conf and
     /lib/modules/2.4.17_mvl21-linuxplanet/modules.dep files:
  /etc/modules.conf
  /lib/modules/2.4.17_mvl21-linuxplanet/modules.dep files
  4. save configuration executing saveconf command
  # saveconf

  If the configuration was changed to use XEM5600 card and XE2000 card will be
  used instead, then the following procedure must be executed:

  1. edit /etc/modules.conf file; uncomment the following line:
  options xirc2ps_cs if_port=4
  2. execute steps 2 and 4 as described above


Upgrading from 2.2.0 Actions
============================

- The OpenSSH was upgraded from 3.7.1.p2 to 3.8.1p1. The new version does 
  not accept authentication method "gssapi", but accepts the new method
  "gssapi-with-mic". If you use Kerberos TGT, please check if your ssh
  client accepts the authentication method "gssapi-with-mic".
  If you use NIS to do the authentication, you need to configure the parameter
  UseLogin as YES in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.

- The file /etc/snmpd.conf was renamed to /etc/snmpd.sh. If you had modified
  /etc/snmpd.conf, apply the same changes to /etc/snmpd.sh.

- The /etc/config_files contains a list of files that are saved to flash
  when you run "saveconf". If you had run "saveconf" with release 2.2.0,
  your /etc/config_files is loaded from the flash and you will not have
  the latest list. 
  Please edit /etc/config_files and do the following actions :
  1) rename the file /etc/snmpd.conf to /etc/snmpd.sh
  2) rename the file /etc/ppp/options to /etc/ppp/options*
  3) run saveconf

- The pmusers group has removed. The following files were changed :
  1) file /etc/rc.sysinit.If there is one saved in flash it must be 
     replaced/merged with /etc/rc.sysinit.save.
  2) file /etc/group. If the file was not changed just replace it with the 
     file /etc/group.save.


Upgrading from 2.1.6 Actions
============================

- The WebUi was changed. The following actions must be taken :
  1) The server.pem and the cert.pem are in /new_web/Locale directory. If the 
    files were changed, copy the file to the new directory.
  2) The file /etc/group was changed, the "admin" group and "biouser" group 
     was inserted. 
     If the file were not changed just replace it with the file /etc/group.save.
     Otherwise the administrator need to edit the file and insert the following
     lines:
		admin::104:root<enter>
		biouser::105:<enter>
  3) The WebUi authentication is done by PAM/local. The users that can use 
     the WebUI need to be included in the local database (/etc/passwd).
     Use the following command to add Admin User :
          #adduser -G admin <username> <enter>
     Use the following command to add Regular User :
          #adduser <username> <enter>

     The new WebUI authentication method through PAM  requires the  service
     "web" in the file "/etc/pam.conf".

    #
    # The PAM configuration file for the `web' service
    #
    web auth       required   pam_unix2.so
    web account    required   pam_unix2.so
    web password   required   pam_unix2.so md5
    web session    required   pam_unix2.so

  4) To configure the HTTP/HTTPS, you need to edit the file /etc/webui.conf.
     By default, HTTP and HTTPS are enabled.
     To disable HTTP service, change the line "HTTP=YES" to "HTTP=NO".
     To disable HTTPS service, change the line "HTTPS=YES" to "HTTPS=NO".
     To change the TCP ports or security level see the manual.    
  5) The bio users need to be a member of the new group biouser. 
     To include the old users in this group, the administrator need to 
     edit the file /etc/group and to add the usernames in the biouser line
     as in the example :
		biouser::105:userbio1,userbio2,userbio3
     To add new users the following command must be used :
	#adduser -G biouser <username> <enter>

- This version allows the ssh's users to be authenticated by Kerberos TGT.
  The ssh_config and sshd_config files were changed. 
  If these files were not changed just replace it with the files *.save.  
  Otherwise the user should merge these files.
